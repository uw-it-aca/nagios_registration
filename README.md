# Nagios Registration
===================

If you have a large number of servers you manage through a deployment system (such as Ansible, Puppet, or whatnot), and you want to use Nagios to monitor them, this app can help you.  Nagios Registration supports:

* Adding new hosts programatically
* Creating and managing host groups
* Adding services
* Assigning services to hosts

For installation information, [read this](https://github.com/uw-it-aca/nagios_registration/wiki/Installation).  For information about how this app interacts with the rest of your Nagios infrastructure, [read this](https://github.com/uw-it-aca/nagios_registration/wiki/Nagios-Configuration-Files)
